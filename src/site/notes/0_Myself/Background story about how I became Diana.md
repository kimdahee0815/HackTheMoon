# <font color="#ff0000">My Love towards Greek Mythology</font>

I have always loved Greek Mythology since I was a child.

I remember most of the stories about Greek Mythology, even my thesis was related to [^2]Prometheus (plus, Nietzsche and existentialism, which is another topics to talk about). 
The impression Greek mythology left me was so great that it made me want to explore the world, especially Greece. 
Well, I haven't been to Greece yet, but still I eager to go to Greece and explore ancient relics and sites. 

Greek Mythology also made me love art. 
The most rememberable story was about Eros and Psyche, and I've even visited louvre exhibition that took place in korea in 2006 to see that peice of art.
I was in middle school back then, but this painting has been almost encarved in my memory because it was so beautiful to look at.

Anyways, back to my english name story,
Among all of the goddesses, my favorite goddess has been Artemis[^1].

I always have admired her since she was really brave and good at hunting just like men.  
Also, I liked the fact that she is the goddess of chastity.  
She seemed like she can overcome any difficulties and hardship with her own strength and I really liked that.

Being an independent woman like her has always been my dream since I was a little kid.  
That's why, I wanted my English name to be 'Artemis'.. 
but No.. 
That name sounded so obvious, meaning it was too easy to guess about me. ðŸ™„  
So, I looked up online, I found out that there was a name 'Diana', which is another name of Artemis.
Now, That's how my English name has became Diana.

You might ask here though, what does your english name story have anything to do with your blog name?

If I were Artemis, I could reach the moon without no difficulty, because Artemis is the goddess of moon.
But as a human, (since I am not Artemis sadly) I can't reach the moon by myself without spacecraft....

But wait, you know what, the moon had been a biggest challenge before we created spaceship, but we made the way to the moon.

You are not god or goddess, but as a human you can reach your goals like that. 
So yeah, I thought I can maybe - reach seemingly impossible goals, if I put a lot of efforts into it.  

Just like human beings created space shift.  
  
So I thought hack the moon was the right name, 
since 
1. it is related to my name diana,  
2. it reflects my own belief, 

which is
"No matter how hard the challenges that come into my life,  
whatever the challenge is,  
I willÂ **HACK**(figure out)Â **THE**Â way to theÂ **MOON**(impossibility/goals) until my life ends"

Now you know how my name is related to my blog name!
