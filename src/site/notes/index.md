Well, Hello, there! 😀
First of all, Welcome Welcome Welcome!
Welcome to my safe place where I share all of my stories and life journeys 😆🥰
If you have found this place just now, think of me as your future close friend you haven't met yet. 
Because I am going to be honest here and share my lessons and learning, feelings and life journeys just like your best friend does. 😄
Hopefully, you can enjoy reading my posts and feel that you just met 'best-friend material'.
(Just in case you haven't felt that, you can just think of me as a human being who shares interesting life stories online😜🫰🏻)

## WHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?
Well, 'HACK THE MOON' is the name I came up with while I was thinking about my English name.
I have always loved Greek Mythology since I was a child.

Among all of the goddesses, my favorite goddess was Artemis[^1]. 
I always admired her since she was really brave and good at hunting just like men. 
Also, I liked the fact that she is the goddess of chastity.
Being an independent woman like her was my dream when I was a little kid.
So, I wanted my English name to be 'Artemis'.. but that name sounded so obvious, meaning it was NOT FUN. 🤔
I looked up online, I found out that there was a name 'Diana', which is another name of 'Artemis'!
That's how my English name became 'Diana'.

>[!quote]+ Your Questions now..
>Okay.. so?
What does your 'English name' story have anything to do with that?

Alright, Alright.
Getting to that noww! (DON'T BE SO IMPATIENT)

Well, Artemis' symbol is moon.
The moon has been a challenge until human beings created spaceship.
As a human being, (since I am not Artemis sadly) I can't reach the moon by myself, (without spacecraft) but I thought I could reach 'seemingly' impossible goals, if you put a lot of efforts into it. 
Just like human beings created space shift.
Meaning, I would **HACK**(figure out) **THE** way to the **MOON** until my life ends. 

Meaning that,
>[!important] I WILL CHALLENGE MYSELF MY WHOLE LIFE AND NEVER GIVE UP.

So, there. Now you know what it means! 🙂🙂

## Let me see the map here!
Well, you can basically find all the things you need when you go to Hack The Moon Info page. 🫠
There, you can find 10 recent files for each section. 
Most of the information would go into 3_Learning section.
