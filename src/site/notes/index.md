Hello, there! 😀  
Welcome to my blog Hack The Moon! 🌙🥰  
This place is for sharing not only my knowledge and learning I got from my experiences, but also my life journeys and stories.  
If you are wondering about who I am, there's a good chance that you are gonna get to know me by just reading my posts, since I am going to tell you lots of things happening in my life here. 😊  
Hopefully, you can enjoy the contents and get any useful/helpful insights or information you have been looking for. 🎈

## WHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?
'HACK THE MOON' is the name I came up with while I was thinking about my English name.  
I have always loved Greek Mythology since I was a child.

Among all of the goddesses, my favorite goddess was Artemis[^1].
I always admired her since she was really brave and good at hunting just like men.  
Also, I liked the fact that she is the goddess of chastity.  
Being an independent woman like her has been my dream since I was a little kid.  
So, I wanted my English name to be 'Artemis'.. but that name sounded so obvious, meaning it was not fun. 🙄  
I looked up online, I found out that there was a name 'Diana', which is another name of 'Artemis'!  
So, that's how my English name has became 'Diana'.  
  

You might ask here though, what does your 'English name' story have anything to do with your blog name?

Artemis' symbol is the moon.  
The moon has been a challenge until human beings created spaceship.  
As a human, (since I am not Artemis sadly) I can't reach the moon by myself without spacecraft, but I can maybe reach seemingly impossible goals, if I put a lot of efforts into it.  
Just like human beings created space shift.  
  
So I thought, well, why don't I name my blog as 'Hach The Moon'?  
Because, no matter how hard the challenges that come into my life,  
whatever the challenge is,  
I will **HACK**(figure out) **THE** way to the **MOON**(impossibility/goals) until my life ends!  
  
Now you know what 'HACK THE MOON' means. 😄

## Let's Hack The Moon together!
Let me show you the map before you explore this place.  
you can find all the things you need when you go to [[Hack The Moon Info\|Hack The Moon Info]] page. 🫠  
There, you can find 10 recent notes for each section.  
If you couldn't find the note, you can try searching notes in the search bar on the left side!  
You can also search notes by tags as well. (ex. #monthly)  
  
Just in case if you clicked the page and there was nothing there, there's a good chance that it didn't get published yet (or it is a private page🥲)!  
Unless it's a private page, it will be soon published. 🙂  
  
Plus, you can find some nice overviews of the section when you go to each section.  
This will help you to overview all the notes for that section.

Here in the graph, you can find the notes that are connected to the post you are reading at the moment.  
This will show how the notes are connected with each other so it can be helpful when it comes to finding the connections between concepts!  
On the left side, there are small emojis that link my linkedIn, github.  
If you want to contact me, feel free to reach out via linkedIn or github 😄!  
For the small sun icon, you can change your screen to light/dark mode.  
The sun emoji that has small moon inside is automatic mode so the mode will be changed according to your timezone.☀️🌙

P.S. In case you are wondering about the reports for each note, they basically show how many hours I spent for specific activities/experiences, what I did for the day and the week for each section.  
The reports help me to track how I spend my time everyday and every week, so it helps me to reflect on my day or my whole week.  
But I doubt that you are wondering about it(since they are not contents), so I decided to leave that out in my blog. 😅

#### DISCLAIMER
Before you get into any posts..!  
I am writing these posts in English, but my native language is Korean.  
Sometimes, it is much easier for me to write posts in Korean than English.  
However, I will try to write my posts mostly in English, because English is a global language, I want everyone who doesn't know Korean can also read my posts as well.  
  
My posts in English can be sometimes grammatically wrong or have awkward expressions(if you do find any, please leave a comment, I would really appreciate it!!), but I am going to keep trying to improve my English knowledge and skills to write posts in English (even if I am wrong). 😊  

Now, without further ado,
