Local police officer

On Christmas Even, main character Ethan goes to airport to work as a security officer as usual. He normally does trivial work and slacks off at work but he decided to ask his boss for promotion to get more money. The reason why he needed more money was because Nora got preganant and he wanted to prepare for the future. 

Although Nora urged Ethan to reconsider taking the police academy exam to become a cop, he is still afraid of failing exams and thinks that focusing on making moeny is better than being scarred by the failure again.

His boss didn't think he was a proper person to work at checkpoints for passenger's packages, but after with convincing from Ethan's coworker, his boss allows him to work at checkpoints. But Ethan didn't know what was coming.

He gets a earpiece dropped off by a random traveler and gets threatened by mysterious man to follow his instructions. The instruction was allowing passenger with bomb to pass through. With his girlfriend's Nora's safety held as collateral, he follows mysterious man's instructions. 

On a side story, the local police investigates into an incident that might be related. While she was investigating, she finally gets the clues for this dangerous incident happening at the airport and tries to catch the criminals. 

While there was a tragic death of Ethan's coworker due to Ethan's disobedience for instructions, Ethan tries to outwit criminals and this gives a lot of thrills for the audience. 
In the end, Ethan gets to save his girlfriend and also prevents passengers from death in the taking-off airplane. He gets to become a cop for his great strategy in the end and ends happily ever after. 



## My Plot Interpretation 
I've read a review for Carry-On and I think the reviews are quite well-strucutured. They pointed out some points that I wanted to make while I was watching the movie.
Especially I agree with the part where police story wasn't more developed and underbaked.  
And for me it was quite interesting that the movie pivots around a security officer at the airport and normally main characters have well-known jobs. I liked that it gave me a fresh point of view from security officer at the airport, which I haven't even thought of as a subject for the stories. 

Well, I wanted to write the review as well as lots of reviewers online did, but I think my english needs to be more improved to express what I want to say. But I'd like to point out a few things here though. 

What was interesting about the reviews was that this movie reminds people of a tragic 9/11 incident happened in USA. Come to think of it, I haven't really experienced any forced body searches in the name of national security. But I guess many people might have experienced that, since terrorism can happen any time and anywhere. I think Korea is one of the safest country in the world, so I think I'm blessed in that sense, because I don't have to worry too much about getting killed by annonymous terrorrists. 
Even on holidays like Chirstmas Eve, people had to go through painfully thorough searches from securities. I've once heard from my friend that this processes really wears him down whenever he goes travelling, especially on holiday season. I think I can guess what he means after watching. 

I watched this movie on Chirstmas Eve and it wasn't bad as I thought. I thought this was going to be a movie to kill time, which doesn't imply any important or serious meanings. Well, like I figured, it didn't actually have any serious meanings to ponder upon, but I think it gives enough thrill to enjoy and some different points of views to think about as the movie progresses. 

Oh - and I didn't know the main character was from Kingsman movie at first. But he did look familiar.. I couldn't recognize him right away. But on halfway through the movie, I realized I've seen him somewhere. I searched online and found out he was from Kingsman. 
I don't know.. but I guess something about him changed? That could be reason why I couldn't recognize him at first. üòÖ (I can't point out what has been changed though. üôÉ)
