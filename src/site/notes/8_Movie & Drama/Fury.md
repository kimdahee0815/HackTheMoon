## Memorable Scenes

About the commander, I didn't really have a good feeling at first.
At the beginning of the movie, he forced Norman to kill a german soldier by the gun, so i thought he was just a bad guy who was trying to throw away Norman's humanity.
But as scenes go by, I realized these behaviors were just for Norman. 
Commander wanted his crew to survive.
Because if you don't kill, you will be killed.
That's the law in a war.. that's the sad truth.

Norman and the commander meet Emma, who is a young german girl.
He gave her some eggs and didn't harm her or rape her. 
I was afraid that he is going to do bad things to her at first, but he was respecting women.

He also warned every crew not to touch Emma.
So, I think he was a good guy, he just became really tough because he had to kill people at a war for a long time.
Not only the commander, but also all the crew, I think.
They were not like animals who wanted to do bad things to women or kill young kids (with guns) at first, but they obviously got corrupted by the violence and war.

This was a sad moment.
Emma couldn't speak english but she could tell he is a good guy.
In this scene, he is reading her palm and says 'you will meet one great love in your life later.'
It was a short moment, but they really fell in love with each other.
The saddest thing is, she dies right after he leaves the building.
He found her dead body in the wrecked piles of buildings...
How ironic.. 
I thought she was going to live more because of her palm lines.

When we think about the life ahead of us, it can end without knowing its end.  

It was very unexpected thing that she died and I sincerely felt the tragedy of war at that moment. 
I could see Norman's pure heart was trampled by the rage and sadness..
Before he couldn't kill a man, but after this event, he gets the nickname 'machine'. 
When the crew gave him that name, he also laughed together with the crew, but I just thought that was really tragic because the war made everyone like killing machines.

His responsibility as a commander was amazing.
He wanted to block the crossroads, since this place was where germans passed through.
He made a tough call and all of his crew decided to join.
I admired his bravery and leadership here.

Event tough everybody knows that they are likely gonna be killed, they just laugh it out with the phrase 'BEST JOB I EVER HAD'.
I think this was funny but at the same time I felt this was really ironic and sad.
They had to kill in the circumstance like this, no one couldn't have gotten away from killing someone at a war. 
I don't see the point of war, but people are having wars even at this moment.
I find that extremely sad and hope everyone can live in peaceful world.
I also hope that I get away from the threats from North Korea as well.
I just hope we can live together happily ever after.
There are a lot of people against North Korea in South Korea, but I think I'm just against North Korea's government..
I don't think people living in North Korea have faults, they are just like us and they should also get human rights just like us.
I feel sorry for all the people who are having any suffers from war or government's force.

>[!quote] Ideals are peaceful history is violent

This is really true.
Ideals are always peaceful but the world we are living in is not..
I hope the war ends once and for all..
there should never be a war in the first place.







## My Interpretation 
I am reading the book about world history and read again how world war 1 and world war 2 broke out. I got interested in this subject after reading the book, so I picked this movie to watch today.
I thought this movie awakened how brutal the war is and also in what way humans souls can be corrupted brutally.
Felt sorry for character commander especially, he had to sacrifice and took responsibility even when his crew were dying.
He didn't show a lot of emotions in the movie, but he must be the one who had suffered the most here.
I felt sorry for Norman too. I could empathize with him the most during the movie.
