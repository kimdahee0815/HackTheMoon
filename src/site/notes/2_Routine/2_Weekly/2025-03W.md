## <font color="#ffc000">What is worth remembering about this week?</font>

-  I followed the routines really well this week! Although, there are some changes I have to make for the next week. 
- I set up my schedule a bit tight, so I'm going to adjust my schedule to loosen it a bit.
## <font color="#cbd30b">What did I accomplish this week?</font>

- Following my plan which was solving some Leetcode coding problems and listen to some lectures about AWS Devops professional. 
- Followed the time schedule I set up for this year roughly.
## <font color="#92d050">What could I have done better this week?</font>
- Coding problem solving. Leetcode question which has label hard wasn't easy to solve(Trapping Rain Water). I was trying to solve it for 3 days in a row, but I only could think of O(N^2) solution, not O(1). I couldn't pass the test due to the limited time. (Time-Exceeded) I got the advice from my fellow developer that if solving problem takes too much time, I should look at the answer and then try to level up my skills more quickly. I will solve problems in that way from now on.
- I couldn't do much work on Thinkstorm project. I need to review pull request and also I have to start coding for the tasks I've taken on.
- I wasn't thinking that I couldn't write notes properly when i'm on a subway or bus. I should take that into account and make time for writing resources notes for what I learned when I get back home. 
- I was really exhausted this week, since I had to wake up early in the moring at 5. I should really sleep on time (10 pm) from now on. Most of the times I tried not to past 10, but sometimes I went to bed past 30 minutes, which means I could only sleep for 6 hours and half. I need at least 7 hours sleep.

## <font color="#00b050">What am I grateful for this week, and what am I thinking of?</font>
- I'm really grateful that I still have some people around me that roots for me. I get energy and strength from them and I'm really grateful for that. 
- For this week, I am grateful for my parents that supports me a lot when I'm studying. 

## <font color="#00b0f0">What did I set to achieve this week?</font>
- I adjusted my routine schedule for the next week and I'm planning to stick to my plan. 
- I fixed some problems occured in my blog and also set up obsidian templates for making it easy to write notes whenever I want. I've been doing this for a long time now and I think I've almost finished setting up PKM(Personal Knowledge Management) system now. I'm very proud of what I've done! 😎😎😎

## <font color="#a372f7">What do I want to achieve next week?</font>
- Next week I want to plan ahead everyday before going to bed and also finish tasks that I've set up before and didn't take any action.
