## My Thoughts

Train to Busan scene with Dad dying and the little girl crying got me crying so much.
I've seen that scene a lot of times now but it still kills me every time.
Made me a human faucet ðŸ˜­

Miracle in cell No.7, this girl doesn't know that her dad is gonna get executed at first and find out something is wrong when she calls him back..
Because he used to answer her back, but this time he didn't.
Dad comes back to her daughter last time when he heard her voice and cry in the last scene and bellowed 'I'm sorry, It's my fault.' 
The thing is her dad got caught with misunderstanding in the first place, since he was mentally disabled, he couldn't defend himself well in the court.
But he was sentenced guilty and sentenced to death.
It was much more excruciating since the movie was funny in the beginning.

Life is Beautiful last scene is also really sad..
This is a story about Holocaust.
Dad got caught by german soldiers, but he is walking funny since he knew his son is watching him.
He wanted his son to think that he is playing a hide and seek game.
I remember I watched this movie when I was in middle school, it was the movie that I cried a lot at that time too, since it was really sad. 

### Similarity of these 3 movies
All of 3 movies has relationships between father and their son/daughter. 
Their son/daughter are pretty young, and fathers take care of their children no matter what.
These movies are sad because it reminds me of my dad as well.
Because if I had been in that situation, I think my dad would have done that too.
That's probably why I always become a literal faucet whenever I think of my parents, because I know how much they love me.
It was very touching to see how their love is shown in these movies.

If you wanna watch touching movies today, I highly recommend these movies if you haven't seen them.
