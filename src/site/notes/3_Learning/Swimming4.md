## <font color="#9d0ab3">Freestyle 3 times</font>
- Practice with side stroke
- turn your arms slowly while you kick
- Don't swing your arms too fast! Make it slower.
## <font color="#9d0ab3">Backstroke 4 times</font>
- Use thighs not ankles!
## <font color="#9d0ab3">Breaststroke 3 times</font>
- Practice with small board. It tends to make your body sink, it's natural. Be mindful of your gap between your legs! It should be your shoulder width.
