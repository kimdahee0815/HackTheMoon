## <font color="#9d0ab3">IELTS vs TOEFL</font>
- Overall, IELTS is more organized logically and no technology used, it will feel more natural
- IELTS is more straightforward and clear than TOEFL
### <font color="#92d050">IELTS</font>
- Has a range of accents including canadian, british, american, austrailian ...
	- But, IELTS is not gonna put an accent on there that is completely unintelligible or that you can't understand (won't put really strong scottish accents)
- Listening 30 mins
- Reading 60 mins (3 passages 20 mins each)
- topics are gonna be drawn from similar sources, but more general topics
- Questions types are different - you gonna just use pencil
- Talking to a person
- Speaking is just speaking and not including listening or reading
- Writing is just writing essay and answer the questions, a lot more straightforward
### <font color="#92d050">TOEFL</font>
- Mostly North american accents
- Listening 40-60 mins
- Reading 60-100 mins (don't know the number of passages you gonna get)
- topics are gonna be drawn from similar sources, but more specialized topics are gonna be there(it can be challenging if you don't have specific background knowledge)
- Questions types - drag and drop with technological aspects
- Talking to a computer, maybe feels unnatural because no one is talking back 
- Speaking includes reading and listening test(since you have to summarize the passage you read or talk about your opinions after you listened to conversations)
- Writing has integrated tasks (reading and listening as well)
