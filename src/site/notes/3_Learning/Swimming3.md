- I still have to unfold my arms to some extent. My instructor said that when i swing my arms, I tend to bend my elbow when the arm goes up. I'm trying to pay attention not to bend my arms ever since.

- Same with the backstroke. Although my speed has gone up, I still have to be mindful of not bending my elbows when I do the stroke.

- Difficult practice today, since we had to kick with a board. I had to pay special attention to hinge at the knees instead of my hips. 
- Also, turning my ankles out when I go forward was hard since I should keep the board steady between my legs in the meantime. 
- Kickboard practice is for keeping my knees narrow and teacher said these practices are important to get the posture right from the beginning. She also added that we'll be practicing with the board a lot from now on.
