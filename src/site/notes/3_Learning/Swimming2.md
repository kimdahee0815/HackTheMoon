## <font color="#9d0ab3">Breaststroke practice 4 times</font>
- I got more used to breaststroke now. Teacher told me and my fellow student to try breathing with the swimming kickboard and practice only with kicks! It was only us that she told me to try more advaced skills. I got excited that she thinks I'm good at breaststroke. 
## <font color="#9d0ab3">Backstroke practice 3 times</font>
- I got more faster with backstroke. I used to be scared if the water would go into my nose while I was doing the stroke, but now I'm not as afraid as before. 
## <font color="#9d0ab3">Freestyle practice 1 time</font>
- Need to practice with my arm stretched! I shouldn't bend my arms when I do freestyle.
