이거 좀 먹어봐요. 맛있어요;;Try this, it's good
<!--SR:!2024-12-27,12,285-->
아뇨 전 됐어요. 제가 사실은 해물을 잘 안먹거든요;;Thanks, but I'm good. Actually I don't really eat seafood
<!--SR:!2024-12-16,1,210-->
정말요? 왜 아무말도 안 했어요? 다른거 시켰을텐데;;Really? Why didn't you say anything? We would have gotten something else
<!--SR:!2024-12-16,2,230-->
아니에요. 진짜 괜찮아요. 다른거 다 잘 먹고 있어요;;No no, it's really okay. I'm really enjoying everything else
<!--SR:!2024-12-25,10,285-->
그래도 말씀하시지 - 이거 말고도 시킬거 많았는데;;Still, you should have told us. There were tons of other things we could've ordered
<!--SR:!2024-12-23,8,250-->
그렇긴 한데 저는 진짜 다들 그냥 원하는걸 먹었으면 좋겠어요. 저는 진짜 상관 없어요;;I know what you mean, but honestly, I'd really prefer it if everyone just get what they want. It's really okay/I really don't mind/It's really not a problem
