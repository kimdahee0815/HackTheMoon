- Sometimes, when group of people are smaller, you get more nervous. 
1. Practice - Nobody becomes eloquent speaker overnight
	1. Find someone online for language exchange
	2. Record yourself with audio or video and you have to listen to it. You will see the patterns.
	3. You can also be silly when you are recording yourself
2. Get out of your head mindset - People are rooting for you! They don't think about things you are freaking out. Get your body language in a cofident position and remember that the whole focus isn't on you. 
3. Stop one second and make eye-contact and smile.
4. Recognize emotions that you are feeling in the situation. Think about what goal you have to achieve. Push it off your emotions for a second and go around those emotions.
