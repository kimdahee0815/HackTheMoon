## <font color="#9d0ab3">Freestyle practice 3 times</font>
- Practice more how to breath when you do freestyle. Don't try to lift your head too much when breathing. Practice breathing with turning your head slowly and looking to the side on the surface of the water.
- Don't bend your elbow when you practice, always stretch your arm.
## <font color="#9d0ab3">Backstroke practice 3 times</font>
- Release pressure on my shoulder and neck when I do backstroke. It helps you to go forward easily.
- Don't lift your knees up to the surface, try to release stress on your ankle and use your strength of your ankle to kick smoothly. 
- Don't bend your elbow when you practice, always stretch your arm.
## <font color="#9d0ab3">Learning Breaststroke for the first time </font>
- Don't push your knees to foward when you move forward. Try to bend your ankle to the inner side of your knee and push your feet with your posture. Breath when you spread your feet. Repeat these steps over and over again.
