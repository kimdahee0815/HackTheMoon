회의가 꽤 빨리 진행 되거든요;;The meetings are fairly fast-paced
<!--SR:!2025-02-06,19,270-->
그래서 익숙해질 때까지는 모든 내용을 일일이 다 기억할 필요는 없고요;;So until you get used to it, don't worry too much about keeping track of every little detail
<!--SR:!2025-01-26,12,276-->

<!--SR:!2025-01-25,5,250-->
그리고 회의 전체가 녹음되니까 놓친 내용이 있으면 끝나고 확인할 수 있어요;;And the meetings are entirely recorded, so you can catch up on anything you might have missed afterwards
