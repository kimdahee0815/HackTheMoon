# [[3_Learning/IE 9 Risky English Grammar on the IELTS\|IE 9 Risky English Grammar on the IELTS]] 
## <font color="#9d0ab3">How complex the grammar needs to get 7 on IELTS?</font>

- Simple sentence
	- subject and verb
- Compound sentence
	- linking two ideas together using the conjunctions (using 'and', 'or', 'but', 'yet', 'for', 'nor', 'so')
- Complex sentence
	- add depending clause (ex. use relative clauses which)
	- ex. I go to the store <font color="#ff0000">which</font> is near my house because I love to buy the food <font color="#ff0000">that</font> they have.

- 6 => mix of structure (simple and compound and complex sentences structures and there are some mistakes)
- 7 => using mix of strucutures and not having a lot of mistakes! (80% sentences have no mistakes)
- stick to the sentence structure that you use a lot of times
- past perfect sentence is not used a lot
- Play it safe and don't take too many ridiculous risks!
