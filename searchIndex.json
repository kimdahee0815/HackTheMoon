(6-7 courses dishes for one meal, 100,000 won, which is about $75)\nMaybe on a special day, I might try some of his dishes. 😋\nYoutube Reference\nYoutube Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-29 - Napoli Matfia and Italian football players Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/3_Learning/Report/Youtube/Daily/2024-10-29---Youtube/\">2024-10-29 - Youtube Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/3_Learning/Report/Youtube/Weekly/2024-10-5th---Youtube/\">2024-10-5th - Youtube Weekly Report</a>",

I got interested in this subject after reading the book, so I picked this movie to watch today.\nI thought this movie awakened how brutal the war is and also in what way humans souls can be corrupted brutally.\nFelt sorry for character commander especially, he had to sacrifice and took responsibility even when his crew were dying.\nHe didn't show a lot of emotions in the movie, but he must be the one who had suffered the most here.\nI felt sorry for Norman too. I could empathize with him the most during the movie.\nMovie / Drama References\nMovie / Drama Report\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/8_Movie-&-Drama/Report/Movie-&-Drama/2024-10-29---Fury/\">2024-10-29 - Fury Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/8_Movie-&-Drama/Report/Movie-&-Drama/Daily/2024-10-29---Movie-&-Drama/\">2024-10-29 - Movie &amp; Drama Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/8_Movie-&-Drama/Report/Movie-&-Drama/Weekly/2024-10-5th---Movie-&-Drama/\">2024-10-5th - Movie &amp; Drama Weekly Report</a>",

After all the adventures, when they came back to reality, he started to forget things again.\nHe knew his condition and he left some letters when he was playing a game, he said things like 'I will forget things more and more but I will never forget that I always love you.' When I realized the contents of that letter, it reminded me of my parents. I imagined my parents being like that, and it definitely made me really sad. I was really moved that he was actually trying to leave a message to his son, when his memories are intact.\nAfter this movie, I thought I should have some more moments with my parents and be nicer to them..\nMy Plot Interpretation\n루가루 게임을 하다가 가족 전부가 루가루 게임이 발명된 사람이 살던 시기인 중세로 돌아가는 내용이다. 처음에는 그냥 마을 사람들이 축제하나보다 하고 생각했는데, 진짜 사람이 처형되는 걸 보고 기겁해서는 집으로 돌아와서 자신들이 게임속에 들어가 있는 걸 깨닫는다.\n어린 딸은 늑대인간, 아빠는 사람 마음 읽는 초능력 가지고 있고, 큰 딸은 투명인간, 아들은 도둑, 엄마는 마녀, 할아버지는 늑대인간 잡는 헌터가 된다. 그리고 이들은 모험을 하는데, 여기서 3마리의 늑대인간을 잡아야 게임에서 이기기 때문에, 늑대인간을 잡으려고 한다.\n그러다가 영주의 아내가 늑대인간인걸 알고 그녀를 죽이려 하지만, 나중에는 꼬마애가 죽어서 엄마가 다시 마법으로 얘를 살리고 다시 현실세계로 돌아간다는 내용.\n중간중간에 웃긴 부분들도 나와서 코미디인데 밝은 영화 보고 싶다고 하면 추천!\nWhile one family were doing lugaru game, they return to medieval era when the creator of lugaru werewolf game lived. At first they think this is all part of festival, but after they saw a real person gets executed at the square, they panicked and returned to their house and figured out they were actually inside of the game.\nYoung daughter is a werewolf, Dad has super power to read one's minds, elder daughter is invisible, son is a thief, mom is a witch and grandfather is a werewolf hunter.\nThey start having adventures and the rule of the game is that they should kill 3 werewolves, and only when they finish their tasks, they can return to reality.\nThey found out that wife of feudal lord of the town is a werewolf and tried to kill her, but their young daughter gets killed instead. Devastated mom brought her life back with her magic and they came back to reality after.\nThere were some funny and hilarious parts inside of this movie, so I remember I was laughing from time to time while I was watching this.\nIf you like the comedy and bright adventurous movies, I recommend you to watch this!! 😃\nMovie / Drama References\nMovie / Drama Report\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/8_Movie-&-Drama/Report/Movie-&-Drama/2024-10-30---Family-Pack/\">2024-10-30 - Family Pack Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/8_Movie-&-Drama/Report/Movie-&-Drama/Daily/2024-10-30---Movie-&-Drama/\">2024-10-30 - Movie &amp; Drama Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/8_Movie-&-Drama/Report/Movie-&-Drama/Weekly/2024-10-5th---Movie-&-Drama/\">2024-10-5th - Movie &amp; Drama Weekly Report</a>",

		"content": "WELCOME!\n\nWell, Hello, there! 😀\nFirst of all, Welcome Welcome Welcome!\nWelcome to my safe place where I share all of my stories and life journeys 😆🥰\nIf you have found this place just now, I think you have no idea what this place is for, so let me explain a bit!\nThis place is for sharing not only my knowledge and any lessons and learning I got from my experiences, but also my life journeys and stories.\nI would tell you 'almost' all of the things happening in my life, so there's a good chance that you get to see who I am by just reading my posts. 😊\nHopefully, you can enjoy being around here and get any useful/helpful insights or information you have been looking for. 💖\nWHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?\nWell, 'HACK THE MOON' is the name I came up with while I was thinking about my English name.\nI have always loved Greek Mythology since I was a child.\n\nAmong all of the goddesses, my favorite goddess was Artemis[1].\nI always admired her since she was really brave and good at hunting just like men.\nAlso, I liked the fact that she is the goddess of chastity.\nBeing an independent woman like her has been my dream since I was a little kid.\nSo, I wanted my English name to be 'Artemis'.. but that name sounded so obvious, meaning it was NOT FUN. 🤔\nI looked up online, I found out that there was a name 'Diana', which is another name of 'Artemis'!\nThat's how my English name has became 'Diana'.\n\n[!quote]+ Your Questions now..\nOkay.. hm... but...\nWhat does your 'English name' story have anything to do with your blog name?\n\nArtemis' symbol is the moon.\nThe moon has been a challenge until human beings created spaceship.\nAs a human, (since I am not Artemis sadly) I can't reach the moon by myself without spacecraft, but I think I can maybe reach 'seemingly' impossible goals, if I put a lot of efforts into it.\nJust like human beings created space shift.\nSo I thought, well,\nno matter how hard the challenges that come into my life,\nwhatever the challenge is,\nI will HACK(figure out) THE way to the MOON(impossibility/goals) until my life ends.\nLet's Hack The Moon together!\nLet me show you the map before you explore this place.\nyou can find all the things you need when you go to <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/Hack-The-Moon-Info/\">Hack The Moon Info</a> page. 🫠\nThere, you can find 10 recent files for each section.\nIf you couldn't find the file, you can try searching files in the search bar on the left side!\nAnd, In case if you clicked the page and there was nothing there, there's a good chance that it didn't get published yet! It will be soon published. 🙂\nAlso, you can find some nice overviews of the section when you go to each section.\nIn case you are wondering about the report, they show how many hours I spent for specific activities/experiences, what I did for the day and the week for each section.\nDISCLAIMER\nBefore you get into any posts..!\nI am writing these posts in English, but my native language is Korean.\nSometimes, it is much easier for me to write posts in Korean than English.\nHowever, I will try to write my posts mostly in English, because English is global language, I want everyone who doesn't know Korean can also read my posts as well.\n영어 잘 모르시는 한국인 분들도 여기 포스트가 전부 영어로 되어 있다고 걱정 마세요!\n제가 한국어로도 글 쓸거에요 :)\n(Hm.. should I write posts in both languages maybe.. 🤔)\nMy posts in English can be sometimes grammatically wrong or have awkward expressions, but I am going to keep trying to improve my English skills and write posts in English even if I am wrong. 😊\nNow, without further ado,\nGOOD LUCK NOT GETTING LOST HERE AND\nLET'S HACK THE WAY TO THE MOON TOGETHER!\n\ngoddess of hunt, the wilderness, wild animals, nature vegetation, childbirth, care of children and chastity ↩︎",
