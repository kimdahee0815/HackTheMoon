(6-7 courses dishes for one meal, 100,000 won, which is about $75)\nMaybe on a special day, I might try some of his dishes. 😋\nYoutube Reference\nYoutube Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-29 - Napoli Matfia and Italian football players Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-29 - Youtube Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-5th - Youtube Weekly Report</a>",

I got interested in this subject after reading the book, so I picked this movie to watch today.\nI thought this movie awakened how brutal the war is and also in what way humans souls can be corrupted brutally.\nFelt sorry for character commander especially, he had to sacrifice and took responsibility even when his crew were dying.\nHe didn't show a lot of emotions in the movie, but he must be the one who had suffered the most here.\nI felt sorry for Norman too. I could empathize with him the most during the movie.\nMovie / Drama References\nMovie / Drama Report\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/8_Movie-&-Drama/Report/Movie-&-Drama/2024-10-29---Fury/\">2024-10-29 - Fury Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/8_Movie-&-Drama/Report/Movie-&-Drama/Daily/2024-10-29---Movie-&-Drama/\">2024-10-29 - Movie &amp; Drama Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-5th - Movie &amp; Drama Weekly Report</a>",

		"content": "WELCOME!\n\nWell, Hello, there! 😀\nFirst of all, Welcome Welcome Welcome!\nWelcome to my safe place where I share all of my stories and life journeys 😆🥰\nIf you have found this place just now, I think you have no idea what this place is for, so let me explain a bit!\nThis place is for sharing not only my knowledge and any lessons and learning I got from my experiences, but also my life journeys and stories.\nI would tell you 'almost' all of the things happening in my life, so there's a good chance that you get to see who I am by just reading my posts. 😊\nHopefully, you can enjoy being around here and get any useful/helpful insights or information you have been looking for. 💖\nWHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?\nWell, 'HACK THE MOON' is the name I came up with while I was thinking about my English name.\nI have always loved Greek Mythology since I was a child.\n\nAmong all of the goddesses, my favorite goddess was Artemis[1].\nI always admired her since she was really brave and good at hunting just like men.\nAlso, I liked the fact that she is the goddess of chastity.\nBeing an independent woman like her has been my dream since I was a little kid.\nSo, I wanted my English name to be 'Artemis'.. but that name sounded so obvious, meaning it was NOT FUN. 🤔\nI looked up online, I found out that there was a name 'Diana', which is another name of 'Artemis'!\nThat's how my English name has became 'Diana'.\n\n[!quote]+ Your Questions now..\nOkay.. hm... but...\nWhat does your 'English name' story have anything to do with your blog name?\n\nArtemis' symbol is the moon.\nThe moon has been a challenge until human beings created spaceship.\nAs a human, (since I am not Artemis sadly) I can't reach the moon by myself without spacecraft, but I think I can maybe reach 'seemingly' impossible goals, if I put a lot of efforts into it.\nJust like human beings created space shift.\nSo I thought, well,\nno matter how hard the challenges that come into my life,\nwhatever the challenge is,\nI will HACK(figure out) THE way to the MOON(impossibility/goals) until my life ends.\nLet's Hack The Moon together!\nLet me show you the map before you explore this place.\nyou can find all the things you need when you go to <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/Hack-The-Moon-Info/\">Hack The Moon Info</a> page. 🫠\nThere, you can find 10 recent files for each section.\nIf you couldn't find the file, you can try searching files in the search bar on the left side!\nAnd, In case if you clicked the page and there was nothing there, there's a good chance that it didn't get published yet! It will be soon published. 🙂\nAlso, you can find some nice overviews of the section when you go to each section.\nIn case you are wondering about the report, they show how many hours I spent for specific activities/experiences, what I did for the day and the week for each section.\nDISCLAIMER\nBefore you get into any posts..!\nI am writing these posts in English, but my native language is Korean.\nSometimes, it is much easier for me to write posts in Korean than English.\nHowever, I will try to write my posts mostly in English, because English is global language, I want everyone who doesn't know Korean can also read my posts as well.\n영어 잘 모르시는 한국인 분들도 여기 포스트가 전부 영어로 되어 있다고 걱정 마세요!\n제가 한국어로도 글 쓸거에요 :)\n(Hm.. should I write posts in both languages maybe.. 🤔)\nMy posts in English can be sometimes grammatically wrong or have awkward expressions, but I am going to keep trying to improve my English skills and write posts in English even if I am wrong. 😊\nNow, without further ado,\nGOOD LUCK NOT GETTING LOST HERE AND\nLET'S HACK THE WAY TO THE MOON TOGETHER!\n\ngoddess of hunt, the wilderness, wild animals, nature vegetation, childbirth, care of children and chastity ↩︎",
