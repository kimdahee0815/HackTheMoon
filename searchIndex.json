(6-7 courses dishes for one meal, 100,000 won, which is about $75)\nMaybe on a special day, I might try some of his dishes. 😋\nYoutube Reference\nYoutube Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-29 - Napoli Matfia and Italian football players Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-29 - Youtube Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-5th - Youtube Weekly Report</a>",

I got interested in this subject after reading the book, so I picked this movie to watch today.\nI thought this movie awakened how brutal the war is and also in what way humans souls can be corrupted brutally.\nFelt sorry for character commander especially, he had to sacrifice and took responsibility even when his crew were dying.\nHe didn't show a lot of emotions in the movie, but he must be the one who had suffered the most here.\nI felt sorry for Norman too. I could empathize with him the most during the movie.\nMovie / Drama References\nMovie / Drama Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-29 - Fury Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-29 - Movie &amp; Drama Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-5th - Movie &amp; Drama Weekly Report</a>",

After all the adventures, when they came back to reality, he started to forget things again.\nHe knew his condition and he left some letters when he was playing a game, he said things like 'I will forget things more and more but I will never forget that I always love you.' When I realized the contents of that letter, it reminded me of my parents. I imagined my parents being like that, and it definitely made me really sad. I was really moved that he was actually trying to leave a message to his son, when his memories are intact.\nAfter this movie, I thought I should have some more moments with my parents and be nicer to them..\nMy Plot Interpretation\n루가루 게임을 하다가 가족 전부가 루가루 게임이 발명된 사람이 살던 시기인 중세로 돌아가는 내용이다. 처음에는 그냥 마을 사람들이 축제하나보다 하고 생각했는데, 진짜 사람이 처형되는 걸 보고 기겁해서는 집으로 돌아와서 자신들이 게임속에 들어가 있는 걸 깨닫는다.\n어린 딸은 늑대인간, 아빠는 사람 마음 읽는 초능력 가지고 있고, 큰 딸은 투명인간, 아들은 도둑, 엄마는 마녀, 할아버지는 늑대인간 잡는 헌터가 된다. 그리고 이들은 모험을 하는데, 여기서 3마리의 늑대인간을 잡아야 게임에서 이기기 때문에, 늑대인간을 잡으려고 한다.\n그러다가 영주의 아내가 늑대인간인걸 알고 그녀를 죽이려 하지만, 나중에는 꼬마애가 죽어서 엄마가 다시 마법으로 얘를 살리고 다시 현실세계로 돌아간다는 내용.\n중간중간에 웃긴 부분들도 나와서 코미디인데 밝은 영화 보고 싶다고 하면 추천!\nWhile one family were doing lugaru game, they return to medieval era when the creator of lugaru werewolf game lived. At first they think this is all part of festival, but after they saw a real person gets executed at the square, they panicked and returned to their house and figured out they were actually inside of the game.\nYoung daughter is a werewolf, Dad has super power to read one's minds, elder daughter is invisible, son is a thief, mom is a witch and grandfather is a werewolf hunter.\nThey start having adventures and the rule of the game is that they should kill 3 werewolves, and only when they finish their tasks, they can return to reality.\nThey found out that wife of feudal lord of the town is a werewolf and tried to kill her, but their young daughter gets killed instead. Devastated mom brought her life back with her magic and they came back to reality after.\nThere were some funny and hilarious parts inside of this movie, so I remember I was laughing from time to time while I was watching this.\nIf you like the comedy and bright adventurous movies, I recommend you to watch this!! 😃\nMovie / Drama References\nMovie / Drama Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-30 - Family Pack Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-30 - Movie &amp; Drama Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-10-5th - Movie &amp; Drama Weekly Report</a>",

He normally does trivial work and slacks off at work but he decided to ask his boss for promotion to get more money. The reason why he needed more money was because Nora got preganant and he wanted to prepare for the future.\nAlthough Nora urged Ethan to reconsider taking the police academy exam to become a cop, he is still afraid of failing exams and thinks that focusing on making moeny is better than being scarred by the failure again.\nHis boss didn't think he was a proper person to work at checkpoints for passenger's packages, but after with convincing from Ethan's coworker, his boss allows him to work at checkpoints. But Ethan didn't know what was coming.\nHe gets a earpiece dropped off by a random traveler and gets threatened by mysterious man to follow his instructions. The instruction was allowing passenger with bomb to pass through. With his girlfriend's Nora's safety held as collateral, he follows mysterious man's instructions.\nOn a side story, the local police investigates into an incident that might be related. While she was investigating, she finally gets the clues for this dangerous incident happening at the airport and tries to catch the criminals.\nWhile there was a tragic death of Ethan's coworker due to Ethan's disobedience for instructions, Ethan tries to outwit criminals and this gives a lot of thrills for the audience.\nIn the end, Ethan gets to save his girlfriend and also prevents passengers from death in the taking-off airplane. He gets to become a cop for his great strategy in the end and ends happily ever after.\nMy Plot Interpretation\nI've read a review for Carry-On and I think the reviews are quite well-strucutured. They pointed out some points that I wanted to make while I was watching the movie.\nEspecially I agree with the part where police story wasn't more developed and underbaked.\nAnd for me it was quite interesting that the movie pivots around a security officer at the airport and normally main characters have well-known jobs. I liked that it gave me a fresh point of view from security officer at the airport, which I haven't even thought of as a subject for the stories.\nWell, I wanted to write the review as well as lots of reviewers online did, but I think my english needs to be more improved to express what I want to say. But I'd like to point out a few things here though.\nWhat was interesting about the reviews was that this movie reminds people of a tragic 9/11 incident happened in USA. Come to think of it, I haven't really experienced any forced body searches in the name of national security. But I guess many people might have experienced that, since terrorism can happen any time and anywhere. I think Korea is one of the safest country in the world, so I think I'm blessed in that sense, because I don't have to worry too much about getting killed by annonymous terrorrists.\nEven on holidays like Chirstmas Eve, people had to go through painfully thorough searches from securities. I've once heard from my friend that this processes really wears him down whenever he goes travelling, especially on holiday season. I think I can guess what he means after watching.\nI watched this movie on Chirstmas Eve and it wasn't bad as I thought. I thought this was going to be a movie to kill time, which doesn't imply any important or serious meanings. Well, like I figured, it didn't actually have any serious meanings to ponder upon, but I think it gives enough thrill to enjoy and some different points of views to think about as the movie progresses.\nOh - and I didn't know the main character was from Kingsman movie at first. But he did look familiar.. I couldn't recognize him right away. But on halfway through the movie, I realized I've seen him somewhere. I searched online and found out he was from Kingsman.\nI don't know.. but I guess something about him changed? That could be reason why I couldn't recognize him at first. 😅 (I can't point out what has been changed though. 🙃)\nMovie / Drama References\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/carry-on-review-taron-egerton-jason-bateman-netflix-1236085253/\nhttps://screenrant.com/carry-on-movie-review-2024/\nMovie / Drama Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-12-21 - Carry-On Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-12-21 - Movie &amp; Drama Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2024-12-4th - Movie &amp; Drama Weekly Report</a>",

Nurse\nTOEIC doesn't always cut it!\nIELTS is more difficult, tests more academic english\n\nDoes IELTS tests those spoken communication skills more even than TOEFL?\n\nIELTS is more valid exam\nLike TOEFL\n\nWe are not gonna sit and talk to a computer and record ourselves in real life\nWe won't close a business deal staring at the computer and recording a voice memo\nYou won't make friends talking to computer\nYou won't establish any kinds of exchange or relationships\n\nIELTS is easier and more real because it is face-to-face exam, you are talking to a person and writing with pen and paper\nIntegrate with non-verbal skills like eye-contact, making it a real speaking situation in the exam\n\nWhich could be more nerve-wraking in front of computer or just being in front of the real person?\n\nBefore taking the exam, people think it is gonna be easier to talk to computer\nBut talking to computer feels so fake and this is not something we ever do and this makes it a lot harder to be successful at\n3 Parts of the IELTS Speaking test, especially first part\n\nTo get the students relaxed and have a conversation. They kinda ease you into it ex. Do you enjoy shopping? What mall do you go to?\n\nThe reason why people don't get scores that they need\n\nThey don't have balanced practice\n\nGo in extreme directions, either they tend to do too much on the text books\nSolution : you have to study the test and use practice text books but also have to balance that practice with real life english, talking to native speakers, watching movies, listening to music, reading the newspaper ...\nOnly one text book is not enough - 00:07:35 | We make promises that the text book can keep sometimes? (I think I just gave away secrets 😅)\n\nMain issues listeners to think about when they prepare\n\nShould have integrated practice\ntake the test part by part\n\nListening\n\na strong level of comprehension. Watch movies, Listen to music, Watch tv shows\nStrengthen the ability to listen and write at the same time (note taking) - Listen to podcast and taking notes while you listen\n\nQ. When listeners choose materials for listening practice for IELTS or just for general learning, what percentage of material should they aim to understand?\n\nTo be honest with themselves, 100% is not gonna happen!\nDon't be discouraged even if you can't understand every words\nHave attainable goals\nStart with understanding general idea =&gt; 2 months from that time, try and understand maybe half of what they are saying\nType of material is also important\n\nIntermediate ~ upper Intermediate - Don't download TED talks or difficult things. Try sitcom or podcast. ex. ESL pod, Breaking News English- authentic news article but read very slowly\n\nReading\n\nread newspapers and magazines\nStrengthen your skills of skimming and scanning. There's not enough time to read every words and answer\n\nIf listeners have only short amount of time to prepare and want to maximize their time, what's the most effective thing they can do?\n\nMake a honest plan yourself - ex. 1 month left, plan 1 test practice(section 1 practice online) and 1 general english activities to do (2 sitcoms) &amp; give yourselves couple days off\nIntegrate practice into the actual studying! - Get used to things slowly by integrating taking practice exams in studying\n\nEnglish Podcast References\nEnglish-Podcast Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-02 - IE 1 How the Pros Prepare for the IELTS Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-02 - English-Podcast Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-1th - English-Podcast Weekly Report</a>",

Area = Math.min(height1, height2) x width, so for now we don't care about width, since width is going to be decreasing from now on. We care about height factor. The way we could increase height as much as possible is if we decrease the area's width by choosing the indicator(p1 or p2) that has smaller value and move it to next index.\n\nex. [6,9,3,4,5,8] =&gt; p1 = 6, p2 = 8. initial width = 5. 4 cases for moving indicator\n\np1 move to index 1. height value for index 1 is bigger than height value for index 0. (6 -&gt; 9)\n\nwidth = 4 (decreased) height = 8 (increased) (9 &gt; 8) =&gt; can be increased\n\np1 move to index 1. height value for index 1 is smaller than height value for index 0. (6 -&gt; 3)\n\nwidth = 4 (decreased) height = 3 (decreased) (3 &lt; 8) =&gt; decreased\n\np2 move to index 4. height value for index 4 is bigger than height value for index 5. (8 -&gt; 9)\n\nwidth = 4 (decreased) height = 6 (no change) (6 &lt; 9) =&gt; decreased\n\np2 move to index 4. height value for index 4 is smaller than height value for index 5. (8 -&gt; 5)\n\nwidth = 4 (decreased) height = 5 (decreased) (6 &gt; 5) =&gt; decreased\n\nOnly possibility that the whole area can be increased is when we move indicator that has smaller height value in previous comparison to the next position.\n\nDouble check for errors\nTest our code with our test cases\nAnalyze Space and Time Complexity\n\nSolution 1 has bad time complexity. O(N^2) Space complexity is O(1).\nSolution 2 is the best, since it has good time complexity O(N) compared to the first one and good space comlexity as well! O(1)\n\nDeveloping References\nDeveloping Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-14 - Arrays - Question 2 Container With Most Water (Medium) Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-14 - Developing Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-3th - Developing Weekly Report</a>",

If you know the index of that element, big O is O(1).\nex. find third element =&gt; array[2]\n\npush\n\ninsert element from behind of the arrays. bigO is O(1).\nex. array.push(1);\n\ninsert\n\nyou insert element but in specific location. Let's say you pushed element in the middle of array. Then you have to push other elements behind of the inserted element. This is where you have to iterate over elements and set pushed back indeces for every element. bigO is O(N), since you have to iterate over elements.\nex. array=[1,2,3,4,6,7]; array.insert(4, 5); insert 5 to index 4 =&gt; array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n\ndelete\n\ndelete element in specific location. Same as above, you have to set changed index for every element. big O is O(N), since you have to iterate over elements.\nex. array=[1,2,2,3,4,5]; array.delete(2, 2); delete 2 element from index 2=&gt; array = [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nArray Example\n\tconst strings= ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];\n\tconst numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];\n\t// Variable array is somewhere in memory and the computer knows it.\n\t// When I do array[2], i'm telling the computer, hey go to the array and grab the 3rd item from where the array is stored.\n\n\t//push\n\tstrings.push('e'); //O(1)\n\tconsole.log(strings);\n\n\t//pop\n\tstrings.pop(); //O(1)\n\tstrings.pop(); //O(1)\n\tconsole.log(strings);\n\n\t//unshift\n\tstrings.unshift('x'); //O(N)\n\tconsole.log(strings);\n\n\t//splice\n\tstrings.splice(2, 0, 'alien'); //\n\tconsole.log(strings)\n\nstrings array takes up 16 bytes totally. 4 bytes * 4 = 16 bytes of storage (1byte = 8bits, charcter needs 1 byte to store data)\npush\n\nadd element at the end of the array\nO(1)\n\nappend\n\nadd element at the end of the array\nBut, if it is dynamic array, then this can be O(N). Since you have to loop over the elements and move these elements to different space so we can add more element. <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"developing\" href=\"/3_Learning/Arrays-Concept/#array-kinds\">#Array Kinds#Dynamic Array</a>\n\npop\n\nremove elemetn from the end of the array\nO(1)\n\nunshift\n\nadd element at the beginning of the array\nWhen you add element, then all the other elements should be pushed back towards the end. indeces should be realigned agian. We have to iterate all over.\nO(N)\n\nsplice(start index, delete count, items)\n\nyou can delete and also add by this function.\nAdd: splice(2,0,'alien') =&gt; go to index of 2, and delete no elements, add 'alien' element to that index place\n\nyou loop half of the elements, since you add element in the place of index 2. You loop after the index of 2. So, bigO would be O(N/2), but according to the rule of bigO <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"developing\" href=\"/3_Learning/Big-O/#simplifying-big-o\">Big O#Simplifying Big O#Remove Constants</a>, you get O(N).\n\nDelete: splice(2,1) =&gt; delete 1 element from the index of 2\n\nyou delete index from index 2, and since the index 2 element is gone, all the other elements should be pulled back forwards. This means you have to iterate elements after the index of 2. you get O(N/2), but just like the case above, you get O(N).\n\nArray Kinds\nStatic Array\n\nWhole array size is fixed, arrays are allocated in adjacent blocks of memory. You can't keep adding things on after the max array size.\nIf you want to add more data after the max size, you copy the whole array and move whole array to different place and allocate more memories so that you can add more elements.\nC++, C ... (Low level languages) - Machine memory management, User have more control over memories so it can be faster\n\nDynamic Array\n\nappend cab be O(N) according to Dynamic Array\njavascript (High level languages) - Automatic memory management, Machine takes chare of memory management so it can be slower\n\nImplementing an Array\nHow to build array from the beginning?\nclass MyArray{\n\tconstructor(){\n\t\tthis.length = 0;\n\t\tthis.data = {};\n\t}\n\tget(index){\n\t\treturn this.data[index];\n\t}\n\tpush(item){\n\t\tthis.data[this.length] = item;\n\t\tthis.length++;\n\t\treturn this;\n\t}\n\tpop(){\n\t\tconst removedItem = this.data[this.length - 1];\n\t\tdelete this.data[this.length - 1];\n\t\tthis.length--;\n\t\treturn removedItem;\n\t}\n\tdelete(index){\n\t\tconst item = this.data[index];\n\t\tdelete this.data[index];\n\t\tfor(let i = index + 1; i &lt; this.length; i++){\n\t\t\tthis.data[index] = this.data[i];\n\t\t\tindex++;\n\t\t}\n\t\tdelete this.data[this.length - 1];\n\t\tthis.length--;\n\t\treturn item;\n\t}\n\tdelete2(index){ //different method\n\t\tconst item = this.data[index];\n\t\tthis.shiftItems(index);\n\t\tthis.length--;\n\t\treturn item;\n\t}\n\tshiftItems(index){\n\t\tfor(let i = index; i &lt; this.length - 1; i++){\n\t\t\tthis.data[i] = this.data[i+1];\n\t\t}\n\t\tdelete this.data[this.length - 1];\n\t}\n}\nconst array = new MyArray();\nconsole.log(array.push(3));\nconsole.log(array.push(5));\nconsole.log(array.get(0));\nconsole.log(array.get(1));\nconsole.log(array.pop());\nconsole.log(array)\nconsole.log(array.pop());\nconsole.log(array)\nconsole.log(array.push('a'));\nconsole.log(array.push('b'));\nconsole.log(array.push('c'));\nconsole.log(array.push('d'));\nconsole.log(array.delete(0));\nconsole.log(array)\nconsole.log(array.delete2(1));\nconsole.log(array)\n\nDeveloping References\nDeveloping Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-14 - Arrays Concept Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-14 - Developing Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-3th - Developing Weekly Report</a>",

Usually O(1).\nJavascript Object is type of Hash Tables\n\nWhat is a Hash Function?\n\nFunction that generates a value of fixed length for each input that it gets\n\nex. SHA-256, SHA-1\n\nIdempotent. Hash function is one way. If you give result value to anyone, It isn't possible to know what key was.\nHash function takes time to process\n\nHash Tables Functions\n\nInsert, lookup, delete, search bigO is all O(1). Because, you have the key assigned everything becomes very simple.\n\nHash Tables Example\n\tlet user = {\n\t\tage: 54,\n\t\tname: 'kyle',\n\t\tmagic: true,\n\t\tscream: function(){\n\t\t\tconsole.log('ahhhhh!');\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tconsole.log(user.age); //lookup O(1)\n\tuser.spell = 'abra kadabra'; //Insert O(1)\n\tconsole.log(user);\n\tuser.scream(); //lookup O(1)\n\nHash Table Problem\n\nCollision!\n\nHash Function can generate same memory space for different keys, since memory is limited\nWhen we put different data in the same memory space, we use linked list(separate chaining)\nYou will get O(N/K). K = size of the hash table. In worst case scenario, K could be 1, which every data goes into same buckets. Then, bigO will be O(N).\n\nArrays vs Hash Tables\n\nHash tables are great for searching, arrays are bad for searching\nkeys can be picked in Hash Tables, but array's key is set(index).\nHash tables data is all over the place, but arrays data will be contiguous\n\nDeveloping References\nDeveloping Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-14 - Hash Tables Concept Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-14 - Developing Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-3th - Developing Weekly Report</a>",

(육체 구성요소 갖춰져야 =&gt; 그 다음이 영혼이 갖춰질 수 있다?)\n\n예를 들어, 육체는 하프의 줄이나 현과 같은 물질적인 것이고 조화로운 화성은 소멸되지 않는 완전하고 신적인 것이라고 할 수 있다. 하지만 이런 화성은 하프의 줄이나 현이 잘 조화가 되어야 나올 수 있는 것이다.\n이와 비슷하게 육체는 열기와 냉기, 습기와 건조 등의 요소들이 하프의 줄 같은 역할을 하고 이러한 것들이 합쳐졌을 때 조화로운 영혼이 생긴다.\n그러면 만약에 이런 육체의 줄이 끊어졌을 때, 죽음에 이르거나 병이 생길 때, 이러한 조화로운 합성물인 영혼은 제일 먼저 소멸하지 않을까?\n\n소크라테스의 주장\n\n위의 주장이 맞는다면 '영혼은 육체에 갇히기 전에 어딘가에 존재하고 있었음에 틀림이 없다. 지식은 상기이다.'라는 주장은 맞지 않는다. 왜냐하면 영혼이 육체에 매어진 여러 줄로 이뤄진 조화라면, 육체가 있기도 전에 앞서서 존재한다는 것은 말이 되지 않기 때문이다. 그러니까 이 두 주장이 서로 어불성설이다.\n조화라는 것은 영혼과 같은 게 아니다. 하프의 줄과 소리가 부조화의 상태로 먼저 존재하고, 그 후 마지막으로 조화가 생기는 것이다. 그래서 영혼을 조화로 보는 사상과 앞서 주장한 것은 일치할 수가 없다.\n육체의 조화로 영혼이 생기는 것이 아니라, 부조화인 육체에 조화로운 영혼이 들어가는 것이다.\n영혼에는 정도의 차이가 있을 수 없다. 좋은 영혼과 나쁜 영혼이 있는 게 아니라 선하고 악한 영혼이 있는 것이다. 하지만 조화는 정도의 차이가 있다. 가능한 한도에 따라 더 참되고 더 충분하게 조화될 때는 더 좋은 조화, 덜 참되고 불충분하게 조화될 때는 더 못한 조화가 있을 수 있다.\n영혼은 조화라고 주장하는 사람들은 덕이 있는 영혼을 조화가 되었고, 악을 행하는 영혼을 부조화라고 할텐데, 그 말은 말이 되지 않는다. 왜냐하면 영혼에는 정도의 차이가 없으므로 조화도 정도의 차이는 없기 때문이다. 부조화도 조화와 마찬가지로 더하고 덜한 점이 없는 셈인데, 그렇게 따지면 영혼은 결코 악할 수가 없다. 왜냐하면 조화는 그 자체가 절대적으로 조화이므로 부조화와는 관련이 없기 때문이다.\n그리고 영혼이 조화라면, 오로지 영혼은 육체의 조화에 어긋나는 일을 능동적으로 행할 수 없고 육체의 조화를 따라야 하는데, 육체가 목이 마를 때 영혼은 물을 마시는 것을 막을 수도 있고 배고플 때 음식을 먹지 못하게 하는 경우도 있으므로 영혼은 능동적으로 행할 수 있다. 따라서, 영혼은 조화가 아니다.\n\n케베스의 반대 이론\n영혼이 육체보다 더 지속적임을 인정하기는 하지만 영혼이 여러 육체들을 입어서 낡게 만든 다음에는 영혼 자신이 소멸하고 뒤에 마지막 육체만 남기는 것이 아닐까? 그러니까 육체가 아니라 영혼이 파괴되는 것이 죽음이다. 영혼도 죽을 수 있지 않을까?\n소크라테스의 주장\n논제 가정\n\n아름다움 자체 외에도 아름다운 것이 있다면 그것은 아름다움 자체를 나눠서 가지고 있는 경우에만 아름답다. 이 외에도 어떤 것을 크다 작다라고 말할 때에는 그 자체가 가지고 있는 본질에 의해서만 크다, 작다라고 해야지 어떤 것과 비교하여 크다, 작다라고 말할 수 없다.\n\n어떤 사람에 대하여 키가 작다, 크다를 말할 때는 그 사람 자체의 본질이 크고 작기 때문이 아니라 어떤 것 과 비교해서 크다, 작다를 말할 수 있고, 어떤 사람은 다른 사람에 비하여 클 수도 있지만 작을 수도 있으므로, 그 '사람'은 크다, 작다의 본질을 동시에 가지고 있을 수 있다.\n그러나 '크기' 자체의 본질은 두 개의 속성을 같이 가질 수 없다. 즉 170cm의 키를 가진 사람은 그 키가 그대로이고, 변하지 않는 것과 마찬가지이다.\n\n열과 불은 다른 것이며, 냉기는 눈과는 다르다. 눈이 열의 영향을 받을 때, 눈이나 열은 눈 또는 열로 그대로 남아 있지 못하고 열이 접근 할 수록 눈은 물러나거나 사라져 버린다. 열도 냉기가 접근함에 따라 물러나거나 사라져버린다.\n3이라는 수는 홀수에 속한다. 3은 그 고유한 명칭으로 부를 수도 있지만 홀수라는 이름으로도 부를 수 있다. 3은 '홀수 자체'는 아니면서도 홀수이다.\n대립되는 것들만이 서로 배척하는 게 아니라, 서로 대립되는 것은 아니더라도 대립되는 것을 내포하고 있는 것은 서로 배척한다. 이러한 것들은 자기 자신 안에 들어 있는 이데아와 반대되는 이데아를 배척하고, 반대되는 이데아가 접근할 때 사라지거나 물러난다.\n위와 같은 원리를 적용하면 '영혼'은 육체를 살아 있게 만들고 생명을 준다. 죽음은 생명의 반하는 개념이다. 영혼은 자신이 초래하는 것(생명)과 반대되는 것(죽음)을 결코 받아들이지 않을 것이다.\n결론 : 영혼은 불멸이다.\n\nBook References\nBook Report\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-16 - 소크라테스의 변명3 Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-16 - Book Daily Report</a>\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">2025-01-3th - Book Weekly Report</a>",

		"content": "WELCOME!\n\nHello, there! 😀\nWelcome to my blog Hack The Moon! 🌙\nThis place is for sharing not only my knowledge and learning I got from my experiences, but also my life journeys and stories.\nIf you are wondering about who I am, there's a good chance that you are gonna get to know me by just reading my posts, since I am going to tell you lots of things happening in my life here.\nHopefully, you can enjoy the contents and get any useful/helpful insights or information you have been looking for. 🎈\nWHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?\nTwo steps before naming my blog,\n\nGoogling 'Blog Name Ideas'\nThinking about my English Name\n\nAt first I was thinking hard how to name my blog, but I couldn't think of any.\nI was thinking about naming my blog as my name 'diana' or 'dahee', but that just wasn't interesting.\nWell, the easiest way to get ideas is always googling, right? (I'd like to say I came up with the idea right out of my head.. 😃 but i'm being honest here, Google gives me lots of ideas to start from. 😅)\nSo I searched how to name my blog and I found the website to give some ideas generated by AI.\nI gave AI some keywords and run it a few times and it gave me thousands of ideas.\nBut, still, I have to choose the right one for me.\nAnd I found the name that sounds amazing, which was 'Hack The Moon'.\nThere is a story about how this is related to my name, but since that is not the point I'm just going to give you the link below!\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Background story about how I became Diana</a>\nLet's Hack The Moon together!\nLet me show you the map before you explore this place.\nyou can find all the things you need when you go to <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"1\" href=\"/Hack-The-Moon-Info/\">Hack The Moon Info</a> page.\nThere, you can find 10 recent notes for each section.\nIf you can't find the note, you can try searching notes in the search bar on the right side top.\nYou can also search notes by tags as well. (ex. #monthly)\nJust in case if you clicked the page and there was nothing there, there's a good chance that it didn't get published yet (or it is a private page😅)!\nUnless it's a private page, it will be soon published. 🙂\nPlus, you can find some nice overviews of the section when you go to each section.\nThis will help you overview all the notes for that section.\n\nHere in the graph, you can find the notes that are connected to the post you are reading at the moment.\nThis will show how the notes are connected with other notes so it can be helpful when it comes to finding the connections between concepts.\nOn the left side, there are small emojis that link my linkedIn, github.\nIf you want to contact me, feel free to reach out via linkedIn or github 😄!\nFor the small sun icon, you can change your screen to light/dark mode.\nThe sun emoji that has small moon inside is automatic mode so the mode will be changed according to your timezone.☀️🌙\nP.S. In case you are wondering about the reports for each note, they basically show how many hours I spent for specific activities/experiences, what I did for the day and the week for each section.\nThe reports help me to track how I spend my time everyday and every week, so it helps me to reflect on my day or my whole week.\nBut I doubt that you are wondering about it(since they are useful for me not you guys), so I decided to leave that out from my blog. 😅\nDISCLAIMER\nBefore you get into any posts..!\nI am writing these posts in English, but my native language is Korean.\nSometimes, it is much easier for me to write posts in Korean than English.\nHowever, I will try to write my posts in English, because English is a global language, I want everyone who doesn't know Korean can also read my posts as well.\nMy posts in English can be sometimes grammatically wrong or have awkward expressions (if you do find any, please leave a comment, I would really appreciate it!), but I am going to keep trying to improve my English knowledge and skills to write posts in English (even if I am wrong). 😊\nNow, without further ado,\nGOOD LUCK NOT GETTING LOST HERE AND\nLET'S HACK THE WAY TO THE MOON TOGETHER!",
