Hello, there! 😀  
Welcome to my blog Hack The Moon! 🌙
This place is for sharing not only my knowledge and learning I got from my experiences, but also my life journeys and stories.  
If you are wondering about who I am, there's a good chance that you are gonna get to know me by just reading my posts, since I am going to tell you lots of things happening in my life here. 
Hopefully, you can enjoy the contents and get any useful/helpful insights or information you have been looking for. 🎈

## <font color="#9d0ab3">WHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?</font>
Two steps before naming my blog,

1. Googling 'Blog Name Ideas'
2. Thinking about my English Name

At first I was thinking hard how to name my blog, but I couldn't think of any.
I was thinking about naming my blog as my name 'diana' or 'dahee', but that just wasn't interesting.
Well, the easiest way to get ideas is always googling, right? (I'd like to say I came up with the idea right out of my head.. 😃 but i'm being honest here, Google gives me lots of ideas to start from. 😅)
So I searched how to name my blog and I found the website to give some ideas generated by AI.
I gave AI some keywords and run it a few times and it gave me thousands of ideas.

But, still, I have to choose the right one for me.

And I found the name that sounds amazing, which was 'Hack The Moon'.
There is a story about how this is related to my name, but since that is not the point I'm just going to give you the link below!

Let me show you the map before you explore this place.  
you can find all the things you need when you go to [[Hack The Moon Info]] page. 
There, you can find 10 recent notes for each section.  
If you can't find the note, you can try searching notes in the search bar on the right side top.  
You can also search notes by tags as well. (ex. #monthly)  
  
Just in case if you clicked the page and there was nothing there, there's a good chance that it didn't get published yet (or it is a private page😅)!  
Unless it's a private page, it will be soon published. 🙂  
  
Plus, you can find some nice overviews of the section when you go to each section.  
This will help you overview all the notes for that section.

Here in the graph, you can find the notes that are connected to the post you are reading at the moment.  
This will show how the notes are connected with other notes so it can be helpful when it comes to finding the connections between concepts.

On the left side, there are small emojis that link my linkedIn, github.  
If you want to contact me, feel free to reach out via linkedIn or github 😄!  
For the small sun icon, you can change your screen to light/dark mode.  
The sun emoji that has small moon inside is automatic mode so the mode will be changed according to your timezone.☀️🌙

P.S. In case you are wondering about the reports for each note, they basically show how many hours I spent for specific activities/experiences, what I did for the day and the week for each section.  
The reports help me to track how I spend my time everyday and every week, so it helps me to reflect on my day or my whole week.  
But I doubt that you are wondering about it(since they are useful for me not you guys), so I decided to leave that out from my blog. 😅

Before you get into any posts..!  
I am writing these posts in English, but my native language is Korean.  
Sometimes, it is much easier for me to write posts in Korean than English.  
However, I will try to write my posts in English, because English is a global language, I want everyone who doesn't know Korean can also read my posts as well.  
  
My posts in English can be sometimes grammatically wrong or have awkward expressions (if you do find any, please leave a comment, I would really appreciate it!), but I am going to keep trying to improve my English knowledge and skills to write posts in English (even if I am wrong). 😊  

Now, without further ado, 

## **GOOD LUCK NOT GETTING LOST HERE** AND
