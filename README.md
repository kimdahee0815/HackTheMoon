Well, Hello, there! 😀
First of all, Welcome Welcome Welcome!

## WHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?

Well, 'HACK THE MOON' is the name I came up with while I was thinking about my English name.
I have always loved Greek Mythology since I was a child.

Among all of the goddesses, my favorite goddess was Artemis[^1].
I always admired her since she was really brave and good at hunting just like men.
Also, I liked the fact that she is the goddess of chastity.
Being an independent woman like her was my dream when I was a little kid.
So, I wanted my English name to be 'Artemis'.. but that name sounded so obvious, meaning it was NOT FUN. 🤔
I looked up online, I found out that there was a name 'Diana', which is another name of 'Artemis'!
That's how my English name became 'Diana'.

Your Questions now..
Okay.. so?
What does your 'English name' story have anything to do with that?

Alright, Alright.
Getting to that noww! (DON'T BE SO IMPATIENT)

Well, Artemis' symbol is moon.
The moon has been a challenge until human beings created spaceship.
As a human being, (since I am not Artemis sadly) I can't reach the moon by myself, (without spacecraft) but I thought I could reach 'seemingly' impossible goals, if you put a lot of efforts into it.
Just like human beings created space shift.
Meaning, I would **HACK**(figure out) **THE** way to the **MOON** until my life ends.

Meaning that,

I WILL CHALLENGE MYSELF MY WHOLE LIFE AND NEVER GIVE UP.

So, there. Now you know what it means! 🙂🙂

## Let me see the map here!

Well, you can basically find all the things you need when you go to Hack The Moon Info page. 🫠
There, you can find 10 recent files for each section.
Most of the information would go into 3_Learning section.
Other files, well folder names are very obvious, you know the drill. 🙂

If you couldn't find the file, you can search files in the search bar on the left side!

[^1]: goddess of hunt, the wilderness, wild animals, nature vegetation, childbirth, care of children and chastity
