Hello, there! üòÄ<br />
Welcome to my blog Hack The Moon! üåô<br />
This place is for sharing not only my knowledge and learning I got from my experiences, but also my life journeys and stories. <br />
If you are wondering about who I am, there's a good chance that you are gonna get to know me by just reading my posts, since I am going to tell you lots of things happening in my life here. <br />
Hopefully, you can enjoy the contents and get any useful/helpful insights or information you have been looking for. üéà<br />

## WHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?
Two steps before naming my blog, <br /><br />
1. Googling 'Blog Name Ideas'<br />
2. Thinking about my English Name<br /><br />
At first I was thinking hard how to name my blog, but I couldn't think of any.<br />
I was thinking about naming my blog as my name 'diana' or 'dahee', but that just wasn't interesting.<br />
Well, the easiest way to get ideas is always googling, right? (I'd like to say I came up with the idea right out of my head.. üòÉ but i'm being honest here, Google gives me lots of ideas to start from. üòÖ)<br />
So I searched how to name my blog and I found the website to give some ideas generated by AI.<br />
I gave it some keywords and run it a few times and it gave me thousands of ideas.<br /><br />
But, still, I have to choose the right one for me.<br /><br />
And I found the name that sounds amazing, which was 'hack the moon'.<br />
There is a story about how this is related to my name, but since that is not the point I'm just going to give you the link below! <br />

## Let's Hack The Moon together!
Let me show you the map before you explore this place.  <br />
you can find all the things you need when you go to [[Hack The Moon Info]] page.   <br />
There, you can find 10 recent notes for each section.  <br />
If you can't find the note, you can try searching notes in the search bar on the right side top.  
You can also search notes by tags as well. (ex. #monthly)  <br /><br />
Just in case if you clicked the page and there was nothing there, there's a good chance that it didn't get published yet (or it is a private pageüòÖ)!  <br />
Unless it's a private page, it will be soon published. üôÇ  <br /><br />
Plus, you can find some nice overviews of the section when you go to each section.  <br />
This will help you overview all the notes for that section.  <br /><br />

<br />
Here in the graph, you can find the notes that are connected to the post you are reading at the moment.  <br />
This will show how the notes are connected with each other so it can be helpful when it comes to finding the connections between concepts.<br /><br />

On the left side, there are small emojis that link my linkedIn, github.  <br />
If you want to contact me, feel free to reach out via linkedIn or github üòÑ!  <br />
For the small sun icon, you can change your screen to light/dark mode.  <br />
The sun emoji that has small moon inside is automatic mode so the mode will be changed according to your timezone.‚òÄÔ∏èüåô<br /><br />

P.S. In case you are wondering about the reports for each note, they basically show how many hours I spent for specific activities/experiences, what I did for the day and the week for each section.  <br />
The reports help me to track how I spend my time everyday and every week, so it helps me to reflect on my day or my whole week.  <br />
But I doubt that you are wondering about it(since they are useful for me not you guys), so I decided to leave that out from my blog. üòÖ<br /><br />

#### DISCLAIMER
Before you get into any posts..!  <br />
I am writing these posts in English, but my native language is Korean.  <br />
Sometimes, it is much easier for me to write posts in Korean than English.  <br />
However, I will try to write my posts in English, because English is a global language, I want everyone who doesn't know Korean can also read my posts as well.  <br /><br />
  
My posts in English can be sometimes grammatically wrong or have awkward expressions(if you do find any, please leave a comment, I would really appreciate it!), but I am going to keep trying to improve my English knowledge and skills to write posts in English (even if I am wrong). üòä  <br /><br />

Now, without further ado, <br /><br />
