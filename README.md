Well, Hello, there! 😀
First of all, Welcome Welcome Welcome!
Welcome to my safe place where I share all of my stories and life journeys 😆🥰
If you have found this place just now, I think you have no idea what this place is for, so let me explain a bit!
This place is for sharing not only my knowledge and any lessons and learning I got from my experiences, but also my life journeys and stories. 
I would tell you 'almost' all of the things happening in my life, so there's a good chance that you get to see who I am by just reading my posts. 😊
Hopefully, you can enjoy being around here and get any useful/helpful insights or information you have been looking for. 💖

## WHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?

Well, 'HACK THE MOON' is the name I came up with while I was thinking about my English name.
I have always loved Greek Mythology since I was a child.

Among all of the goddesses, my favorite goddess was Artemis[^1]. 
I always admired her since she was really brave and good at hunting just like men. 
Also, I liked the fact that she is the goddess of chastity.
Being an independent woman like her has been my dream since I was a little kid.
So, I wanted my English name to be 'Artemis'.. but that name sounded so obvious, meaning it was NOT FUN. 🤔
I looked up online, I found out that there was a name 'Diana', which is another name of 'Artemis'!
That's how my English name has became 'Diana'.

Your Questions now..
Okay.. hm... but...
What does your 'English name' story have anything to do with your blog name?

Artemis' symbol is the moon.
The moon has been a challenge until human beings created spaceship.
As a human, (since I am not Artemis sadly) I can't reach the moon by myself without spacecraft, but I think I can maybe reach 'seemingly' impossible goals, if I put a lot of efforts into it. 
Just like human beings created space shift.

So I thought, well, 
no matter how hard the challenges that come into my life, 
whatever the challenge is,
I will **HACK**(figure out) **THE** way to the **MOON**(impossibility/goals) until my life ends. 

## Let's Hack The Moon together!
Let me show you the map before you explore this place. 
you can find all the things you need when you go to Hack The Moon Info page. 🫠
There, you can find 10 recent files for each section. 
If you couldn't find the file, you can try searching files in the search bar on the left side!
And, In case if you clicked the page and there was nothing there, there's a good chance that it didn't get published yet! It will be soon published. 🙂

Also, you can find some nice overviews of the section when you go to each section.
In case you are wondering about the report, they show how many hours I spent for specific activities/experiences, what I did for the day and the week for each section. 

Also, before you get into any posts..!
I am writing these posts in English, but my native language is Korean.
Sometimes, it is much easier for me to write posts in Korean than English.
However, I will try to write my posts mostly in English, because English is global language, I want everyone who doesn't know Korean can also read my posts as well.

영어 잘 모르시는 한국인 분들도 여기 포스트가 전부 영어로 되어 있다고 걱정 마세요!
제가 한국어로도 글 쓸거에요 :)

(Hm.. should I write posts in both languages maybe.. 🤔)

My posts in English can be sometimes grammatically wrong or have awkward expressions, but I am going to keep trying to improve my English skills and write posts in English even if I am wrong. 😊

Now, without further ado, 

## $${\color{green}GOOD \space LUCK \space NOT \space GETTING \space LOST \space HERE \space AND}$$

# $${\color{red}LET'S \space HACK \space THE \space WAY \space TO \space THE \space MOON \space TOGETHER!}$$
