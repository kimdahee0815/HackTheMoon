Hello, there! üòÄ<br />
Welcome to my blog Hack The Moon! üåôü•∞<br />
This place is for sharing not only my knowledge and learning I got from my experiences, but also my life journeys and stories. <br />
If you are wondering about who I am, there's a good chance that you are gonna get to know me by just reading my posts, since I am going to tell you lots of things happening in my life here. üòä<br />
Hopefully, you can enjoy the contents and get any useful/helpful insights or information you have been looking for. üéà<br />

## WHAT DOES 'HACK THE MOON' MEAN?

'HACK THE MOON' is the name I came up with while I was thinking about my English name.<br />
I have always loved Greek Mythology since I was a child.<br />

<br />
Among all of the goddesses, my favorite goddess was Artemis[^1]. <br />
I always admired her since she was really brave and good at hunting just like men. <br />
Also, I liked the fact that she is the goddess of chastity.<br />
Being an independent woman like her has been my dream since I was a little kid.<br />
So, I wanted my English name to be 'Artemis'.. but that name sounded so obvious, meaning it was NOT FUN. üôÑ <br />
I looked up online, I found out that there was a name 'Diana', which is another name of 'Artemis'..!<br />
That's how my English name has became 'Diana'.<br />
<br />

But what does my 'English name' story have anything to do with my blog name?<br />

<br />
Well, the thing is, Artemis' symbol is the moon.<br />
The moon has been a challenge until human beings created spaceship.<br />
As a human, (since I am not Artemis sadly) I can't reach the moon by myself without spacecraft, but I think I can maybe reach seemingly impossible goals, if I put a lot of efforts into it. <br />
Just like human beings created space shift.<br />
<br />
So I thought, well, why don't I name my blog as 'Hach The Moon'? <br />
Because, no matter how hard the challenges that come into my life, <br />
whatever the challenge is,<br />
I will **HACK**(figure out) **THE** way to the **MOON**(impossibility/goals) until my life ends. <br />

## Let's Hack The Moon together!

Let me show you the map before you explore this place. <br />
you can find all the things you need when you go to Hack The Moon Info page. ü´†<br />
There, you can find 10 recent files for each section. <br />
If you couldn't find the file, you can try searching files in the search bar on the left side!<br />
Just in case if you clicked the page and there was nothing there, there's a good chance that it didn't get published yet (or private page)! <br />
If they are not published yet, it will be soon published. üôÇ<br />
Also, you can find some nice overviews of the section when you go to each section.<br />

Here in the graph, you can find the notes that are connected to the post you are reading at the moment.<br />
This will show how the notes are connected with each other so it can be helpful when it comes to finding the connections between concepts!<br />
On the left side, there are small emojis that link my linkedIn, github. <br />
If you want to contact me, feel free to reach out via linkedIn or github üòÑ! <br />
For the small sun icon, you can change your screen to light/dark mode! <br />
The sun emoji that has small moon inside is automatic mode so the mode will be changed according to your timezone.‚òÄÔ∏èüåô

P.S.
In case you are wondering about the reports for each note, they basically show how many hours I spent for specific activities/experiences, what I did for the day and the week for each section. <br />
The reports help me to track how I spend my time everyday and every week, so it helps me to reflect on my day or my whole week. <br />
But I doubt that you are wondering about it(since they are not contents), so I decided to leave that out in my blog. üòÖ<br />

#### DISCLAIMER

Before you get into any posts..!<br />
I am writing these posts in English, but my native language is Korean.<br />
Sometimes, it is much easier for me to write posts in Korean than English.<br />
However, I will try to write my posts mostly in English, because English is global language, I want everyone who doesn't know Korean can also read my posts as well.<br />
<br />
My posts in English can be sometimes grammatically wrong or have awkward expressions(if you do find any, please leave a comment, I would really appreciate it!!), but I am going to keep trying to improve my English knowledge and skills to write posts in English (even if I am wrong). üòä<br />
<br />
Now, without further ado, <br />
